Artificial intelligence

Full Spectrum Command (FSC) is a “commercial platform training aid” developed by the USC Institute for Creative
Technologies and Quicksilver Software, Inc. for the U.S.Army. A commercial platform training aid is a computer
game designed not for entertainment, but as a training tool to achieve a targeted training objective. Like most video games and training simulations, Full Spectrum Command includes a significant artificial intelligence (AI) system that controls the behavior of the user’s subordinate units and the
opposing forces.

This complex AI system, which controls up to 200 entities and uses 60% of the CPU’s processingcycles, is an excellent example of game industry AI technology, a branch of AI little studied by the academic research community. In addition, Full Spectrum Command includes an Explainable AI (XAI) feature that is the result
of an academic research effort motivated by previous work in systems such as Mycin (Shortliffe 1976), Debrief
(Johnson 1994), and the Explainable Expert System (Swartout, Paris and Moore 1994). The goal of this paper
is to describe the XAI system and its application in Full Spectrum Command.

However, this requires an understanding of the AI system in FSC that controls the
Non-Player Characters (NPCs) (i.e. the computer controlled soldiers). This NPC AI is interesting in its own
right as an example of a game industry AI system,including the methodologies and technologies employed by
game developers.
